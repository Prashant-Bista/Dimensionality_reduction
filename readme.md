1)Train a random forest classifier on the MNIST dataset and time how long it takes, then evaluate the resulting model on the test set. Next, use PCA to reduce the datasetâ€™s dimensionality, with an explained variance ratio of 95%. Train a new random forest classifier on the reduced dataset and see how long it takes. Was training much faster? Next, evaluate the classifier on the test set. How does it compare to the previous classifier? Try again with an SGDClassifier. How much does PCA help now?
